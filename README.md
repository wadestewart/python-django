###Why I chose Python
I chose Python because I heard that through multiple instructors and speaker that it is a widely used language among different fields, such as data science. Also, it has many similarities to Ruby, so it should be easier to pick up than other languages that I have no point of reference for (such as Java, C, etc.). I was first made aware of it in squad scrums, Brian asked why we were learning Ruby and not Python. Mike said he used this 'teach yourself' day as an opportunity to learn it on his own. Also, one of the hiring managers that spoke during Outcomes talked about Python. I asked him about Python v Ruby and he expressed liking Python more.
