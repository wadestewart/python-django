### Comfort: 4.
I'm always hesitant to say 5, but I felt pretty comfortable working through the environment configuration (Rashad took the lead on this) and troubleshooting a few problems that arose. We came out the other side of it, or at least are comfortable in the thick of it.

### Why I chose Python
I chose Python because I heard that through multiple instructors and speaker that it is a widely used language among different fields, such as data science. Also, it has many similarities to Ruby, so it should be easier to pick up than other languages that I have no point of reference for (such as Java, C, etc.). I was first made aware of it in squad scrums, Brian asked why we were learning Ruby and not Python. Mike said he used this 'teach yourself' day as an opportunity to learn it on his own. Also, one of the hiring managers that spoke during Outcomes talked about Python. I asked him about Python v Ruby and he expressed liking Python more.

### My opinion of the Django
I like the structure of configuring your app in the virtual environment, doing the heavy lifting in the beginning. The MRT model is nice for quick and easy builds, but I think it could get repetitive over a period time. I am sure there are many features of Django that I did not get to, so it's difficult to make a definitive assessment there.

### Instructions to run
You would need to install Python3. Once in the 'mysite' environment, you would need to install pip, psycopg2, and django.
